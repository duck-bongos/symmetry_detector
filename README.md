# symmetry_detector
#### Stony Brook University CSE 528 Computer Graphics final course project
A program to detect symmetry for people. We will start with focusing on symmetry detection in faces, before moving towards detection for other parts of the body.

Using `C++`'s `dlib` library, find a symmetry plane for a person's face.

May include conversion from 3D objects to 2D surfaces.
